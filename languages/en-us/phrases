YEEAH
is this a meme?
that's what she said!
it works on my machine
thatâ€™s weird
almost finished
a chip off the old block
a deer in the headlights
a drop in the bucket
a fish out of water
a fly in the ointment
a horse of a different color
a knockoff
a long row to hoe
a nail-biter
a penny for your thoughts
a pox on both your houses
a quick buck
a stitch in time saves nine
a tongue-lashing
ace up his sleeve
airing dirty laundry
an uphill battle
and the rest is history
another nail in the coffin
ants in his pants
as dense as a London Fog
as easy as falling off a log
as snug as a bug in a rug
as useful as a lead balloon
at the drop of a hat
back from the dead
back in the saddle
back to the salt mines
bare bones
barking up the wrong tree
beat a dead horse
born with a silver spoon in his mouth
burn your bridges
busier than a one-armed paper hanger
by the skin of my teeth
can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
cash cow
cat got your tongue?
clean your clock
come hell or high water
cooking with gas now
cool as a cucumber
cost an arm and a leg
couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
cry over spilled milk
dig yourself into a hole
don't reinvent the wheel
dot the I's and cross the T's
dumber than a box of rocks
easy as 123
eat lead!
eats like a horse
everything but the kitchen sink
fall head over heels
fell through the cracks
fighting like cats and dogs
firing on all cylinders
fits like a glove
flat as a pancake
free as a bird
get a word in edgewise
get cleaned out
get off on the wrong foot
get over the hump
give the shirt off your back
give them an inch and they'll take a mile
go against the grain
good things come to he who waits
good to the last drop
has egg on his face
he's all thumbs
his bark is worse than his bite
hit pay dirt
hold your horses
home is where you hang your hat
hunker down
I could whip you with one arm tied behind my back
I need that like I need a hole in the head
I wasn't born yesterday
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached
Idle hands are the devil's workshop
if the shoe fits, wear it
if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
I'll eat my hat
in two shakes of a lamb's tail
in your face
is it soup yet?
it won't fly
it's in the mail
jump down your throat
jump the gun
just the tip of the iceberg
keeping up with the Joneses
keeps his cards close to his vest
kick some ass
knee-high to a grasshopper
knock it out of the park
knockout blow
know it like the back of my hand
know which side your bread is buttered on
last but not least
lay my cards on the table
leave no stone unturned
like a bull in a china shop
like a kid on a candy store
like a knife through hot butter
like night and day
lock, stock, and barrel
looking for a needle in a haystack
love is blind
madder than a wet hen
making a mountain out of a mole hill
making money hand over fist
many hands make light work
miss the boat
money doesn't grow on trees
my brain is fried
nailed it
nice guys finish last
no pain, no gain
no skin off my nose
no strings attached
not for all the tea in china
not playing with a full deck
not the ghost of a chance
off kilter
old as dirt
on the same page
on track
one man's garbage is another man's treasure
one picture is worth a thousand words
out of gas
out of the woods
paint yourself into a corner
play the hand you're dealt
play with the big boys
play with the big girls
pound the pavement
pull the wool over your eyes
put it on the back burner
put that in your pipe and smoke it
raking in the dough
rattle your cage
reopen an old wound
right up your alley
rock the boat
Rome wasn't built in a day
rotten to the core
rub salt in the wound
run circles around
run rings around
same song and dance
season's greetings
see the glass as half empty
send up a trial balloon
something to sink your teeth into
soup to nuts
step on your toes
stop on a dime
stuck out like a sore thumb
sweep it under the rug
swim against the tide
take a long walk off a short pier
take a picture, it will last longer
test the waters
the 800-pound gorilla
the blind leading the blind
the cat's meow
the grass is always greener on the other side
the lights are on buy nobody's home
the old ball and chain
the red carpet treatment
the whole enchilada
throw gasoline on the fire
tilting at windmills
time on your (or my) hands
to deep six something
to sugar coat something
candy-coat something
too many chefs spoil the broth
toot your own horn
turn over a new leaf
under a microscope
until the cows come home
variety is the spice of life
waiting for the dust to settle
waiting for the other shoe to drop
waiting for your ship to come in
walking on egg shells
welcome to the club
we're gonna tie one on tonight
were you born in a barn?
what a zoo -- or -- this place is a zoo
what's wrong with this picture?
when all is said and done
when hell freezes over
when pigs fly
where there's smoke there's fire
wipe the slate clean
with a fine tooth comb
with one hand tied behind my back
work your fingers to the bone
works like a dog
yank your chain
you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
you can take that to the bank
you can't fit a square peg in a round hole
you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube
you could have knocked me over with a feather
you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet
you lost me
you make a better door than a window
you snooze, you loose
zip your lip
